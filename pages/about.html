        Education should be accessible to all. <em>Period.</em> This is why at
        Aspire Access, we strive to provide quality education to people around
        the world. We currently offer over 400 courses at up to 100% lower cost
        than any other program. Our funding for courses comes from grants
        provided by the US Department of Education, Google, Microsoft, and other
        companies. Our goal is to be able to provide free courses by utilizing
        the public library system to allow student to use their books for free.
        Together we can give <strong>ALL</strong> students the opportunity to
        succeed.
